# End-to-End Machine Learning Project on Student Performance


This repository provides a modular template for building end-to-end machine learning workflows in Python. The structure is designed for scalability and clarity, separating each stage of the ML pipeline into its own component.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```powershell
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd mlprojects
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or, use the setup script:
   ```powershell
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment    

This project includes configuration for deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk:
- The `.ebextensions/python.config` file sets the WSGI entry point for your application. Update the `WSGIPath` as needed for your main app (default: `application:application`).
- For more details, see the [AWS Elastic Beanstalk Python documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create-deploy-python-container.html).

## Localhost Web Server Usage

To serve your model via a web server (for example, using Flask or FastAPI), run your application and access it locally:

- **Default local server URL:**
  
  [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

Update the port if your application uses a different one. You can now send requests to your deployed model endpoint for inference and testing.

## Usage
- Implement your logic in the respective component files under `src/components/` and pipelines under `src/pipeline/`.
- Use `exception.py` for consistent error handling across the project.
- Extend `logger.py` and `utils.py` as needed for logging and utility functions.
